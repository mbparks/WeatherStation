# BAROGRAPH

Field Instrument No. 067. A Victorian observatory drum that records live weather from a personal weather station. The drum carries seven days of chart paper: pressure drawn in oxblood ink, temperature in prussian, with the pen resting on the present moment. Below the drum, a column of registers keeps a seven-day record of every measurement: anemograph for wind, hygrograph for humidity, pluviograph for rainfall, actinograph for sunshine and ultraviolet. Around them, a shelf of instruments: mercury thermometer, aneroid barometer with set hand, hygrometer, wind rose, rain gauge, and a storm glass whose crystals answer the pressure trend.

Current version: 1.2.0

## Data source

BAROGRAPH is fed by WX-RELAY, a Cloudflare Worker that proxies the Weather Underground PWS API and keeps the key server-side. The default worker URL is set in Settings and can be changed to any WX-RELAY deployment. Routes used: `/current` (refresh loop), `/today` and `/hourly?date=YYYYMMDD` (drum traces).

## Features

- Full meteorograph wall: every measurement carries its own weeklong register on matching chart paper, all built on one generic strip renderer. The hygrograph traces relative humidity in mulberry with DRY, TEMPERATE, and DAMP engraved at the margin. The pluviograph traces daily cumulative rainfall in indigo, and the trace drops to nought at midnight in the manner of a siphon rain recorder. The actinograph traces solar radiation in burnt umber with the ultraviolet index stippled above it. Day lines align down the whole column.
- Anemograph register: wind speed traced in verdigris ink on a second strip sharing the drum's cylindrical geometry, so day lines align between the two records. Gusts are recorded as vertical pen flicks in the manner of a recording anemometer, and Beaufort words (BREEZE, FRESH, NEAR GALE, GALE, STORM) are engraved at the right margin where they fall within scale.
- Seven-day drum with cylindrical wrap: time compresses toward the drum edges, grid lines sag with the paper, a brass pen arm scratches at the last observation, and the drum sits in flickering gaslight in the night theme.
- Aneroid barometer with a set hand marking the reading three hours past, in the manner of a hall barometer, plus classic RAIN / CHANGE / FAIR engraving.
- Storm glass with four states (clear, faint haze, blooming stars, climbing ferns) keyed to the three-hour pressure trend, with period-appropriate captions.
- Live, cached, and demo sources: if the wire goes quiet the instrument falls back to its last cached readings, and failing that to a demonstration week of synthetic weather. The badge in the header always tells you which you are looking at.
- Local-first: settings and the latest readings persist in the browser. Export and import carry them between machines.
- Three themes (night default, day, high contrast), all verified programmatically for WCAG AA contrast in the test harness.
- Imperial and metric units end to end, including drum scales, dial faces, and gauge graduations.
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion: pen scratch, lamp flicker, and rain drops all go still.

## Test harness

Append `?test=1` to the page URL to run the built-in harness in the browser. The same twenty-six tests run headless in node by extracting the embedded script. Coverage: WU payload normalization, series building and de-duplication, pressure trend thresholds, storm glass states, compass points, drum geometry monotonicity and edge compression, Beaufort scale words, wind, gust, rain, solar, and ultraviolet extraction from history fields, humidity and sun words, weekly rainfall summation, tidy scale maxima, register well-formedness, demo determinism and siphon behavior, SVG well-formedness across all three themes, and WCAG contrast ratios for every theme palette.

## Known limitations

- No sound in this release. A clockwork tick and rain-on-glass ambience are on the roadmap, with the standard mute button.
- Typefaces (IM Fell English) load from Google Fonts. Without a network the instrument degrades gracefully to Georgia and remains fully functional; a self-hosted font option is a candidate for a later release.
- Drum history depends on the WU history endpoints. A station that only recently began reporting will show a shorter trace.
- The seven previous-day history fetches happen once per hour; a station with gaps in its record will show pen lifts (breaks) in the trace, which is honest behavior for a barograph.
- The pluviograph relies on the station's day-cumulative rainfall total; a station that resets its total on a different schedule will show the siphon drop at its own reset hour.
- The storm glass is poetic, not predictive. Real storm glasses were not predictive either.

## Development standards

Single-file HTML, no build step, local-first, GPL-3.0. Night-default theming with day and high contrast modes. Version number displayed in the header, footer, and page title. Debug logging behind the Settings toggle. Feedback drawer with copy-to-clipboard and optional mailto. Each release is preserved as its own file under `releases/`.

## Changelog

- 1.2.0: The full meteorograph. Three new registers below the anemograph: hygrograph (humidity in mulberry), pluviograph (daily cumulative rainfall in indigo with siphon resets at midnight), and actinograph (solar radiation in burnt umber, ultraviolet stippled). All four strips rewritten onto one generic register renderer. Rain, solar, and ultraviolet now collected in series, refresh, cache, and demo weather. Six new harness tests, twenty-six in all.
- 1.1.0: Anemograph strip below the drum. Wind speed in verdigris ink, gusts as pen flicks, Beaufort engravings at the margin, day lines aligned with the drum above. Wind and gust now collected in the series, live refresh, cache, and demo weather. Beaufort caption under the strip with the week's high gust. Four new harness tests, twenty in all.
- 1.0.0: Initial release. Seven-day drum with pressure and temperature traces, pen arm, gaslight flicker. Thermometer, aneroid with set hand, hygrometer, wind rose, rain gauge, storm glass, heliography and station plaques. Live/cached/demo sources, export/import, three themes, sixteen-test harness.
